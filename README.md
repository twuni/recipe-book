# Recipe Book

An app for home cooks to find, view, and manage recipes from a
touch-screen device mounted right in the kitchen.

## No, really. What is this?

This project is designed to teach the fundamentals of launching a new
JavaScript project. It's like...

> https://github.com/twuni/ante-boilerplate-js

...but with a meaningful commit history explaining every step of the
way, with an explanation for **why** each decision was made, and the
context influencing that decision.

The fundamentals covered in this project are generally applicable to
any technology. Yes, specific technology choices must be made here in
ordre to make progress, but one key lesson stands out above the rest:

> The technology choice you make is not important. What matters is
> **why** you made that decision, and that it was the best choice
> to make at the time.

Building with **mindfulness** and **intention** is something you'll
see come up from time to time in commits. Internalize that, and
you will be well equipped not only to launch a new greenfield
project, but also to have meaningful conversations with your team
about how the codebase is evolving and when it may be time to
re-evaluate choices whose value may have changed or diminished
over time -- or to celebrate and share the results of choices that
have yielded dividends and from which other teams may benefit
by adopting.
